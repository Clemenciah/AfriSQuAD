# Robustness of Machine Reading Comprehension Models
This repository hosts a project on evaluating the generalization capability of MRC models and geo representation of MRC datasets which will be submitted to 
AfricaNLP workshop 2023 co-located with ICLR in Kigali Rwanda.

We intend to investigate:

  1. How diverse are the named entities in the SQuAD datset in terms of geo-location.

  2. How do QA models perform when an entity is swapped from the original dataset with a low resource named entity.
